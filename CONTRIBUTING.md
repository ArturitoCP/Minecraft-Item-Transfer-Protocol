## ü§ù Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MITP! Here are some steps and guidelines to help you contribute effectively:

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**: If you're not a main collaborator, start by forking this repository so you can work on your own copy.

2. **Create a branch**: It's recommended to create a new branch for each set of changes you make. You can do this with:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b branch-name
    ```

3. **Make your changes**: Make the necessary modifications, whether it's adding features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation.

4. **Commit your changes**: Be sure to write clear commit messages that describe what you've done:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Description of the changes"
    ```

5. **Push your changes**: Once you're done, push your changes to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin branch-name
    ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original repository and create a pull request so your changes can be reviewed and, if everything is good, merged.

### Contribution Guidelines

#### Code Style:
- **Functions**: Use camelCase for functions (e.g., `sendItem()`, `validateMessage()`).
- **Table Fields**: Use snake_case for table fields (e.g., `user_name`, `message_body`).
- **Clarity**: Make sure your code is clear and easy to understand. If necessary, add explanatory comments.

#### Testing:
- If you're adding new features, ensure they are adequately tested before submitting a pull request.

#### License:
- Remember that this project is under the GPL-3.0 license. Ensure your contributions comply with it.

#### Code Formatting:
- Follow the code style conventions used in the project. If you're unsure, we can discuss them together.

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug in the project, please open an issue in the repository. Be sure to provide enough details about the error, how to reproduce it, and the environment in which you encountered it.
