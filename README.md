## üîé About
MITP is a protocol for item transfer within Minecraft using [ComputerCraft: Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked). The goal is to establish an efficient connection between devices for the reliable exchange of items and data in Minecraft. MITP simulates the behavior of a basic TCP/IP protocol to ensure transmission reliability and security.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Item Transfers: Send and receive items between devices within Minecraft.
- Session Management: Maintain reliable connections during item transfers.
- Message Validation: Ensures messages are valid with headers, checksums, and authentication.
- Secure Connections: Data encryption and authentication for secure communication.
- Ephemeral Ports: Temporary communication ports for secure, short-term connections.
- Event Handling: New event-subscription system for better flexibility in handling actions.
- Automatic Message Handling: Supports automatic handling of TCP and MITP messages.
- Asynchronous Communication: Non-blocking communication for better performance.
- Encryption: AES encryption and SHA-256 for data security.
- Logging: Built-in activity logging for auditing and debugging.

## ‚úÖ Future Features
- Request Parsing: Parse incoming requests to extract relevant data.
- Response Handling: Automatically build and send responses.
- Credential Verification: Ensure that only authorized devices can send or receive data.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handle and report errors during communication.
- Access Permissions: Verify user/device permissions for secure data exchange.
