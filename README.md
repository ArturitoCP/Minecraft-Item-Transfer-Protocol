## Project status
This project will be temporarily paused due to personal/professional commitments. I will be busy until early December and, during this time, I won't be able to maintain, add new features, or address issues immediately. I deeply appreciate your understanding and patience.

The project will remain available for use as it is, but no new updates are expected until my return.

Thank you for your support and understanding!
